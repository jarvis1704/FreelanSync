<h3> Welcome to the official repo of FreelanSync!</h3> 
<article>
<p> FreelanSync is a revolutionary network which helps connect freelancers and clients, without the hastle of searching each other. This is a revolutionary step towards the domain of Freelancing, where earlier both freelancers and clients had to find each other, and even if they did, they woudn't agree on the terms with each other. Our company aims to change the norm, making freelancing not a side job, as a career option.</p>
<p> Also we are making the source code of our website and algorithms open source! so that our ever growing community can review and give their valuable suggestions and also contribute to the community.</p>
